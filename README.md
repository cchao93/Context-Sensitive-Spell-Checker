# Context-Sensitive-Spell-Checker

Thing to do before writing that paper (in the order of urgency)

MUST BE DONE
- Prune confusion sets & context words using the method Elif talked about and see if that
  improves accuracy
- Precision & Recall
- Use various data sources & take measurements for everything we've done for the paper (k, min-threshold, pruning, etc)

OPTIONAL
- Get trigram Viterbi to work
- Implement collocations & combine it with context words using a Bayesian
  classifier
- Implement word trigrams
- Try SLI and DI for each method
