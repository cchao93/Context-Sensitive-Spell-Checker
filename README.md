# Context-Sensitive-Spell-Checker

Thing to do before writing that paper (in the order of urgency)
- Get trigram Viterbi to work
-* Combine POS trigrams with context words
-* Prune confusion sets using the method Elif talked about and see if that
  improves accuracy
-* Precision & Recall
- Play around with different k and min-threshold values and see if that
  improves accuracy
- Implement collocations & combine it with context words using a Bayesian
  classifier
- Implement word trigrams
- Try SLI and DI for each method
-* Use various data sources & take measurements for everything we've done for  the paper
