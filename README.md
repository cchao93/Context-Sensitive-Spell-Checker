# Context-Sensitive-Spell-Checker

Thing to do before writing that paper (in the order of urgency)

MUST BE DONE
- Combine POS trigrams with context words
- Prune confusion sets & context words using the method Elif talked about and see if that
   improves accuracy
- Stopwords (should include start, end, and unknown tokens)
- Precision & Recall
- Use various data sources & take measurements for everything we've done for the paper

OPTIONAL
- Get trigram Viterbi to work
- Play around with different k and min-threshold values and see if that
  improves accuracy
- Implement collocations & combine it with context words using a Bayesian
  classifier
- Implement word trigrams
- Try SLI and DI for each method
